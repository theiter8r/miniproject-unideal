Phase 1 ──────┬──→ Phase 2 ──→ Phase 3 ──→ Phase 4 ──→ Phase 5
              │                                          ↓
              │                                     Phase 6
              │                                          ↓
              └──────────────────────────────────→ Phase 7
                                                        ↓
                                                   Phase 8
```

- **Phase 1** is prerequisite for ALL phases (foundation)
- **Phase 2** (verification) required before Phase 3 (listings need verification gate)
- **Phase 3** (listings) required before Phase 4 (payments need items to buy)
- **Phase 4** (payments) required before Phase 5 (chat auto-opens after payment)
- **Phase 5** (notifications) and **Phase 6** (reviews) can run in parallel after Phase 4
- **Phase 7** (admin) can start after Phase 2 (verification queue) and is enhanced with Phase 6 data
- **Phase 8** is always last (deployment + polish)
